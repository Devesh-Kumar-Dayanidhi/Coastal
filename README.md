There is no build system yet; all you need to clone, add external dependencies and compile.

All your code should be inside the app folder; your "EntryPoint" is ExampleLayer.h. Code that should be executed before the main loop is inside of "Start()," and code that should be executed inside of the main loop is in "OnUpdate()." As this is a young API, no official documentation has been released, but when it is, it will be linked in the readme.

Happy Programming!
